**Note** - You will be experiencing less frequent updates and slow resolving of issues (unless severe), which you might have noticed already in fast few months. Due to other works, I might not be able to resolve issues for weeks/months. Support the project so I can give it more time, create PR for simple issue such as UI/text change.
