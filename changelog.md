**Note** - You will be experiencing less frequent updates and slow resolving of issues (unless severe), which you might have noticed already in fast few months. Due to other works, I might not be able to resolve issues for weeks/months. Support the project so I can give it more time, create PR for simple issue such as UI/text change.

## Changed

- change in range of some epub-reader-settings options.
- change in behavior of number inputs.

## Fixed

- number input spin button cause input to be min when starting from 0, related #361
